			<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
			<p>
				I am looking for a senior development or architect role where I can contribute my experience in a wide variety of development and implementation projects to 
				solving problems. I'm adept at finding the right solution for business needs and delivering one thing: a product to a customer. I'm fluent with all the current 
				Microsoft development technologies, and I can apply them effectively and intelligently to the situation at hand. Because I've had experience both as a single 
				contractor and in a team of over 30 developers, I'm comfortable working alone without supervision or in a peer-­reviewed team setting.
			</p>
			<p>
				My ideal job is one where I have a high degree of autonomy, but also the opportunity to work with other developers, stakeholders and customers. Unlike 
				a lot of developers, I like talking to customers and figuring out how I can help them solve their business problem. I also love it when I can take a 
				couple hours with my team and a whiteboard and solve a technical problem that would take anyone else days or weeks with emails, meetings, and 
				UML.
			</p>

			<h2 id="about">About me</h2>
			<p>
				I like to consider myself a technologist: I love technology for its ability to solve problems. I'm not a fanboy, although I am pretty fond of 
				my Mac and i-devices which is a little odd considering I've made my living with Microsoft products. But I guess that goes to show that I see
				the merit in all of these things. I consider C# my "home" language, but I also love the expressiveness and flexibility of JavaScript. I like 
				Node's async-ness. I like ASP.NET MVC's out-of-the-box experience. HTML5 is the greatest thing ever to me, but I tolerate XAML pretty well too.
				I play with Xamarin.iOS in my free time and read about obscure database index algorithms on my lunch breaks. I'm pretty awesome at SQL, but I 
				think CouchDB makes a whole lot of sense for most stuff people want to do.

						<li>I was mainly responsible for the architecture and maintenance of the Policy System for CSI's K­12 cloud email solution. This system integrated with Active Directory and allowed administrators to provision resources in the Microsoft Live@Edu cloud and set rules for communication and general configuration. It uses SQL synchronization to copy the desired resource configurations to a datacenter where they are queued for a scalable “job worker” to process them. The system is expandable through the use of dynamically­loaded assemblies that are installed on the customer site.</li>
						<li>I was also responsible for re­architecting and maintaining the ASP.NET security provider that is used in the customer Sharepoint portal. It allows authentication to a local AD but also keeps a cache in a SQL database for fault­tolerance.</li>
						<li>In addition to these major projects, I contributed to the architecture for the WCF communication systems as well as our remote configuration system.</li>

						<li>Developed a proprietary Photo Editing Application (with capabilities similar to basic PhotoShop LE) using Visual Basic and TIBCO. This tool was used by the SportsLine.com news team to edit, compress, and deploy all photos for the web site.</li>
						<li>Developed a real­time data entry tool using Visual Basic and TIBCO. This tool provides the data entry department the ability to easily enter current game status data for MLB games via a simple user interface and then places that data into the SportsLine.com content database.</li>
