  <p>
    <br>
    I'm a technologist, software developer, husband, and father to 3 awesome kids in <a href="http://travelersrestsc.com/">Travelers Rest, SC</a> (just outside of Greenville). I love all kinds of 
    technology and seeing how it can be harnessed to solve problems in the small and problems in the large.

    I'm using this as my repository for my blog, personal projects, and resume so if you're here, you're probably looking for one of those things.
    Check them out in the links below.

      You might want to hire me. If you let me work remotely, let me use the tools I like, and pay me well, you definitely want to hire me. Check out my
      history and qualifications here.
